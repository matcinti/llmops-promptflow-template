    "email": "Subject: Revised Regulatory Framework for Natural Gas in the USA\n\nDear Colleagues,\n\nI am reaching out to update you on the revised regulatory framework for natural gas in the United States, which was announced last Thursday. The new regulations will affect extraction, safety protocols, and emission standards, and are set to take effect from the start of next quarter. We need to evaluate our current operational procedures and make necessary adjustments to comply with these changes.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJohn Parker\nSenior Manager, Regulatory Affairs\nAmerican Gas & Energy"
